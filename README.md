# PyNetcon

Python bindings for netcon. You can find a mirror of the original netcon code [here](https://github.com/TensorCon/netcon).

Follow all [install instructions](https://github.com/TensorCon/netcon/blob/mirror/README.md) for the netcon repository in order to utilize these bindings.

In short, you'll need `octave` and its developer tools (such as `mkoctfile`).

## Install
```pip install pynetcon```

## Usage
See the [tests](test/test_netcon.py)
